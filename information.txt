Kora AI
“Continuous AML RegOps, not quarterly fire drills.”

About
Kora AI is an autonomous RegOps layer for banks and fintechs with serious BSA/AML obligations.
Instead of hiring more analysts and spinning up new point solutions every time regulators tighten the rules, Kora AI connects to your existing stack (core banking, AML platform, case management, data warehouse, payments) and continuously:
Reconciles key AML data flows
Runs controls as executable checks
Collects and normalizes evidence
Maintains a living, audit-ready “evidence graph”
Surfaces gaps and issues ranked by regulatory and dollar impact


We don’t replace your AML/sanctions system. We sit on top and next to it as an autonomous “compliance engineer” that does the boring, high-volume work your team doesn’t have time for.

Product Overview
One-liner:
Kora AI is a continuous compliance agent for BSA/AML — it turns fragmented systems and spreadsheets into a single, real-time, audit-ready view of your AML program, with an AI worker that runs checks and collects evidence automatically.
Core ideas:
Agent, not just dashboard.
 The system doesn’t just visualize; it acts. It writes and executes checks as code in a secure sandbox (CodeAct style) and pushes results back into your evidence graph.
Continuous, not quarterly.
 Compliance is moving from “point-in-time audits” to continuous controls monitoring (CCM). Big firms and consultancies are already pushing CCM as best practice to replace sample-based testing with 24/7 monitoring of full populations.Deloitte+2skan.ai+2
On top of your stack.
 Kora AI integrates with core banking, AML systems (Actimize/ComplyAdvantage/etc.), case management, KYC vendors, and warehouses — instead of trying to rip and replace any of them.



What We Do
At a high level, Kora AI:
Connects to your financial crime ecosystem (core, AML, KYC, payments, DW).
Builds a live model of your AML program: controls, data flows, obligations, systems.
Runs continuous checks (as code) over your data to verify controls are working.
Auto-collects evidence (logs, samples, metrics, configs) into a normalized evidence graph.
Prioritizes issues by regulatory risk and financial exposure.
Prepares audit/exam packs at any time with one click.


Think of it as hiring a tireless “AML DevOps engineer” that keeps your program healthy between audits and enforcement actions.

Features (and the problems they solve)
1. Continuous Evidence Graph
What it is:
 A graph that links obligations → policies → controls → systems → checks → evidence → exceptions in real time.
Problems it solves:
Today, evidence for exams is scattered across spreadsheets, tickets, emails, shared drives, and screenshots.
When regulators ask “Prove control X was operating effectively over the last 12 months,” teams scramble for weeks.
With financial crime compliance costs in the US & Canada alone estimated at $61B per year and rising for 99% of institutions, this manual evidence work is a major driver of cost. LexisNexis Risk Solutions
What Kora does:
Continuously links checks and artefacts to specific obligations and controls.
Makes every control queryable: “Show me last 90 days of evidence for Transaction Monitoring Scenario 12 in US retail bank”.


2. Autonomous Control Checks (Code-as-Control)
What it is:
 An agent that writes and runs executable checks (SQL/Python) to validate AML controls across systems — inspired by the CodeAct pattern where LLMs generate executable code as actions, yielding better performance on tool-use tasks than simple text/JSON.Lalr+1
Problems it solves:
Most banks rely on periodic, sample-based testing of controls; continuous coverage is rare and expensive.Deloitte+2skan.ai+2
There is often no automated way to verify that rules are firing, thresholds make sense, and coverage hasn’t silently degraded after system changes or data quality issues.
What Kora does:
Encodes controls as machine-readable templates (e.g. “Every transaction above $X from region Y must be screened and logged in System Z within 24 hours”).
Agent continuously generates and runs checks to verify those conditions in your data.
When checks fail, it opens an exception with context, data samples, and suggested remediation.

3. Cross-System AML Reconciliation
What it is:
 Automated reconciliation across core banking, AML, case management, KYC, and data warehouse to ensure your AML program is complete and consistent.
Problems it solves:
Global financial crime compliance costs are estimated in the $200B+ range annually, with a heavy share spent on manual processes and reconciliation.Flagright+2Lalr+2
Mid-sized banks especially see compliance expenses consuming ~5–10% of noninterest expense, with smaller banks often at the high end of that range, indicating significant operational drag.Community Banking+2CSBS+2
No one system proves that all transactions, alerts, and customers are consistently represented across all relevant systems.
What Kora does:
Reconciles transaction counts and amounts between core, AML, and data warehouse.
Checks that all high-risk customers exist and are scored consistently across KYC, AML, and CRM.
Validates that all alerts have case outcomes and, where required, regulatory reports (e.g., SARs) attached.


4. Regulatory Runbooks & Live Exam Packs
What it is:
 Codified, automated runbooks for recurring regulatory tasks (e.g., BSA/AML exams, look-back requests, model validation).
Problems it solves:
Every exam or look-back currently triggers ad-hoc “all hands” fire drills, distracting senior staff and frontline teams for weeks.
Regulators increasingly expect banks to demonstrate ongoing effectiveness of AML controls, not just pass a yearly audit.Mayer Brown+1
What Kora does:
Encodes exam workflows as plans the agent can execute:
 “Step 1: Collect last 24 months of TM scenario metrics; Step 2: sample alerts; Step 3: gather evidence of governance; Step 4: assemble report.”
Keeps an exam-ready pack updated so that at any time you can export current evidence and control metrics.


5. Risk-Weighted Exception Prioritization
What it is:
 A prioritization engine that scores issues by regulatory risk + dollar exposure + operational effort.
Problems it solves:
Compliance teams are overwhelmed with alerts, control failures, QA issues, and exam findings; they can’t do everything.
But not all issues are equal: missing KYC on a high-risk correspondent bank is not the same as a minor logging bug.


What Kora does:
Scores exceptions using factors like:
Regulatory link (BSA, OFAC, CFPB consent order, prior MRAs)
Volume and value of impacted transactions
Historical enforcement patterns (e.g., focus on AML program failures)Reuters+3FinCEN.gov+3orx.org+3


Produces a simple queue: “Top 10 issues to fix this week to materially reduce regulatory risk.”


Why It Matters
Massive, growing spend
LexisNexis estimates that financial crime compliance costs in the US and Canada alone have reached $61B/year, with 99% of institutions reporting increased costs and most prioritizing cost reduction.LexisNexis Risk Solutions+2InvestmentNews+2
Earlier global estimates put financial crime compliance spend around $213.9B across surveyed markets.Lalr
More recent industry commentary cites $200B+ globally for financial crime compliance across banks and fintechs.Flagright+1


Catastrophic downside when you get it wrong
TD Bank’s US operations were hit with over $3B in AML-related penalties and forfeiture, a four-year independent monitorship, and a multi-year remediation program, after failures allowed networks to move hundreds of millions of dollars in illicit funds.Investopedia+5FinCEN.gov+5orx.org+5


Structural disadvantage for mid-sized institutions
Compliance expenses can be ~10% of noninterest expense for smaller banks, falling to about 5% for institutions in the $1–10B asset range, showing strong diseconomies of scale.Community Banking+2CSBS+2


Translation:
 Financial institutions are spending eye-watering amounts, especially on labor, yet still getting hit with record fines and monitors because they lack continuous, data-driven, evidence-backed visibility into their AML program.
Kora AI makes continuous AML compliance operationally and economically viable.

How It Fits (Stack Positioning)
Kora AI is not:
A transaction monitoring engine
A sanctions screening tool
A case management system


Kora AI is:
A RegOps & CCM layer on top of your existing AML/KYC stack
An autonomous agent that:
Reads from core, AML, KYC, payments, DW
Runs compliance checks and reconciliations as code
Stores evidence and exceptions in an AML-specific graph


A bridge between the world of GRC/CCM and financial crime specifics, tuned to BSA/AML obligations rather than generic frameworks.Cloud Security Alliance+3Deloitte+3RegScale+3


Typical data sources:
Core banking / ledger
AML transaction monitoring (Actimize, SAS, ComplyAdvantage, etc.)
Sanctions/KYC vendors
Case & investigation tools
Data warehouse / lake
Policy and procedure repositories (for mapping to controls)



The Result
For a mid-sized US/Canadian bank or fintech, successfully deploying Kora AI should mean:
50–80% less manual time spent assembling evidence for BSA/AML exams and audits.
Continuous awareness of control health — no more “we’ll find out next exam if we’re in trouble.”
Fewer and better escalations to senior management and the board, based on data rather than anecdotes.
Reduced probability and severity of enforcement actions due to program failures (especially the “you didn’t have an adequate AML program” type findings, which have led to multi-billion penalties).Reuters+4FinCEN.gov+4orx.org+4
Over time, lower total cost of compliance by automating the rote work and allowing scarce AML experts to focus on investigation and strategic improvements.



Hair-on-Fire Problem Statement
Financial institutions are spending tens of billions per year on AML compliance, yet still face multi-billion dollar fines and multi-year monitorships because they lack a continuous, unified way to prove that their AML programs are working right now.
Evidence:
Cost explosion:
Total financial crime compliance costs in the US & Canada reached $61B/year in 2024, with 99% of financial institutions reporting rising costs and most prioritizing cost reduction.LexisNexis Risk Solutions+2InvestmentNews+2
Global studies have estimated $213.9B in annual financial crime compliance spend across surveyed markets, and more recent commentary pegs global costs at over $200B per year.Lalr+2Flagright+2


Catastrophic downside:
TD Bank’s 2024 settlements illustrate the worst-case scenario: over $3B in AML-related penalties and forfeiture, a four-year monitorship, an asset cap, and large remediation budgets, following failures that left trillions in transactions insufficiently monitored and enabled networks to move over $600M in illicit funds.Reuters+6FinCEN.gov+6orx.org+6


Structural pain for mid-sized institutions:
Compliance expense as a share of noninterest expense is almost double for smaller banks compared to those with $1–10B in assets (around 9.8% vs. 4.9%), showing that they pay a disproportionate cost to meet the same or similar regulatory expectations.Community Banking+2CSBS+2


Summarized pain:
“We spend more every year on AML compliance.”
“We still don’t have a live, single source of truth for our program.”
“We only find out how bad things are when the regulator or internal audit shows up.”


Kora AI exists to turn that hair-on-fire reality into a continuously monitored, auditable, and defensible AML posture.

Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)
Primary ICP (wedge):
Type: Mid-sized US & Canadian banks, credit unions, and digital-first financial institutions (e.g., neobanks, payment processors)
Assets: Roughly $1–$100B in assets or equivalent scale
Regulatory obligations:
Subject to BSA/AML, OFAC, and related regulations
Under recurring exam pressure (OCC, FDIC, FRB, OSFI, provincial regulators)
Stack profile:
Multiple systems for AML, payments, KYC, case management
Data warehouse or lake in place or in-progress
Org symptoms:
AML/compliance teams chronically overworked
Heavy use of spreadsheets and manual evidence collection
History of MRAs/MRIAs, consent orders, or exam findings on BSA/AML
Second-phase extensions: larger banks, insurers with heavy financial crime obligations, and high-growth fintechs scaling into bank-like regulatory scrutiny.

Value Proposition
For our ICP, Kora AI delivers:
Risk reduction:
Continuous visibility into control health, with prioritized issues to fix before the regulator finds them.
Cost optimization:
Reduced manual labor on recurring evidence and reconciliation work; potential to flatten or reduce compliance headcount growth even as regulations tighten.
Time-to-answer:
“Are we compliant right now?” shifts from months-long analysis to minutes.
Audit & exam readiness:
Live exam packs, mapped to controls and supported by evidence, at any time.


You can summarize it as:
“Kora AI converts rising AML compliance spend into a stable, data-driven operating motion, and cuts the tail risk of catastrophic program failures.”

Pain Signals for Discovery Calls
Concrete things a good prospect will say:
“Every exam is a fire drill — we spend weeks chasing evidence across teams.”
“We’ve got several AML tools, but no single picture of whether the program is working end to end.”
“We keep hiring more analysts, but the backlog of reconciliations, QA, and model validation never goes away.”
“Regulators are pushing us toward continuous monitoring, but our tools and processes are still yearly/quarterly.”Deloitte+2skan.ai+2
“We’re worried about becoming the next TD-type headline if a program failure slips through.”Reuters+5FinCEN.gov+5orx.org+5


When we hear 2–3 of these in one conversation, we’re in the sweet spot.
Why It Matters Now
Regulatory pressure is increasing.
North American regulators are openly revisiting AML compliance costs and effectiveness, referencing the LexisNexis $61B estimate as context.Mayer Brown+2LexisNexis Risk Solutions+2
Canada is proposing significantly stronger AML powers and penalties after the TD case, ahead of FATF evaluations.Reuters


Costs keep going up; budgets don’t.
Financial crime compliance costs are rising for nearly all institutions; many report that cutting these costs is a top priority in the next 12 months.Mayer Brown+3LexisNexis Risk Solutions+3InvestmentNews+3


Continuous Controls Monitoring is becoming the standard.
CCM is now a mainstream concept in risk and compliance, especially in financial services — moving away from sample-based testing to full-population, real-time monitoring.Cloud Security Alliance+3Deloitte+3Pathlock+3
Agentic AI is finally practical.
The combination of strong LLMs, code-execution patterns (like CodeAct), and containerized compute makes it feasible to have an agent that runs real checks at scale, not just chats.Lalr+1


All the pieces for Kora AI — regulation, economics, and technology — are converging now, not five years from now.

Canada proposes more powers for anti money-laundering regulator amid increasing scrutiny
December 17, 2024 — Canada has proposed new measures to strengthen its anti-money laundering regulator, the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), by increasing penalties and enhancing coordination with other federal agencies. This comes in response to a recent incident involving TD Bank, which was fined over $3.09 billion in the United States for failing to comply with anti-money laundering regulations. The proposed changes to the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act include a 40-fold increase in penalties, criminal charges for providing false or incomplete information, and a tenfold increase in fines for all criminal offenses. These measures aim to improve Canada's compliance ahead of an evaluation by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in 2025-2026. The FATF previously identified areas needing improvement in Canada's anti-money laundering framework during its 2016 review. The proposal emphasizes encouraging compliance rather than imposing large penalties and includes a penalty limit for individuals and companies.

Connect to core, TM/AML, sanctions/KYC, case management, payments, and DW/lake.
Build a live model of your AML program: obligations → policies → controls → systems → checks → evidence.
Run continuous control checks over full populations (not samples).
Auto-collect evidence (logs, configs, metrics, samples) into a normalized graph.
Detect failures/drift and open exceptions with context + impacted populations.
Push remediation workflows into your operating system (ServiceNow/Jira/GRC), track closure, and continuously re-verify effectiveness.
Generate regulator-ready exam and remediation packs anytime.



Core Modules
1) AML Evidence Graph (System of Record)
A graph that links obligations → controls → systems → checks → evidence → exceptions → remediation proof in real time.
So you can answer instantly:
“Show the last 12 months of operating effectiveness evidence for TM Scenario 12.”
“Show every exception, its owner, and proof the fix held for 90 days.”



2) Code-as-Control Checks (Executable Assurance)
Controls are expressed as machine-readable templates (e.g., timeliness, completeness, screening coverage, alert/case integrity). The agent generates/executes checks in a locked-down sandbox and writes results back to the evidence graph.
When checks fail:
Open an exception
Attach samples + lineage
Recommend remediation steps
Track re-test outcomes automatically



3) Cross-System AML Reconciliation (Completeness + Consistency)
Automated reconciliation across: core ↔ TM ↔ case mgmt ↔ KYC ↔ DW.
 Examples:
Transaction population parity (counts, sums, latency)
Alert-to-case closure integrity
SAR-required case coverage checks
High-risk customer consistency across systems



4) Remediation Autopilot (MRA / Consent-Order Ready)
This is the “make everyone care” module.
Converts exceptions into remediation plans (owners, due dates, required evidence)
Integrates with ServiceNow/Jira/GRC
Tracks closure and continuously re-tests to prove fixes stick
Produces “proof-of-fix” packages regulators expect after major findings Barron's+1



5) Transaction Monitoring Scenario & Model Governance (AML-native MRM)
Continuous “scenario health” monitoring:
Coverage drift, segmentation changes, threshold edits
QA results + approvals + tuning history
KPI trends (false positives, conversion to SAR, backlog risk)
Auto-generated validation support packs



6) Regulator-Ready Exam Packs (One Click)
Prebuilt exam and lookback runbooks that produce structured packs aligned to typical examiner requests:
Control design + operating effectiveness
Population coverage (not samples)
Exceptions and severity
Remediation status + proof-of-fix



ICP (Wedge)
Mid-sized US/Canadian banks, credit unions, and fintechs with:
Multiple AML/KYC systems
Heavy manual evidence collection
Recurring exam pressure
MRAs / findings or fear of becoming the next headline
Disproportionate compliance cost burden (economies of scale problem) St. Louis Fed+1




Why This Matters Now
Enforcement outcomes have shown the catastrophic downside of “program not effective” failures, including multi-billion penalties and operational restrictions. Barron's+1

Outcomes (What You Sell)
50–80% reduction in manual evidence assembly and reconciliation work
Continuous control health visibility (not “we’ll find out at exam time”)
Faster remediation closure with proof-of-fix
Fewer surprise findings and cleaner internal audit narratives
Lower probability/severity of enforcement actions (tail-risk reduction)
